 * \section desc_sec Description
 *
 * The tools have limitations:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The equation must be quadratic, eg the coefficient of x^2 cannot be null
 * <li> The coefficient are real (integer, etc...), complex not allowed
 * </ul>
 *
 * The Eq2deg class is designed to deal with equations having real roots.
 * It throw an exception in case of negative discriminant
 * 
 * The Eq2degComp class is derived from Eq2deg and allow complex roots. The 
 * coefficients needs to be real
 * 
 * \section test Unitary tests
 * 
 * To allow TDD (test driven developpement) basic tests are provided based on
 * the boost unit test framework. The tests are implemented in the 
 * testEq2Deg.cpp file. Tests include both Eq2deg and Eq2degComp tests
 * 
 * \section labs Demo programs
 *
 * The files solver.cpp and solverc.cpp are skeleton that can be used to
 * implement your main programs
